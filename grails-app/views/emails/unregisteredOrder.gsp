            <p>You are receiving this email because you recently purchased a badge for an event from
            a con that uses the SWAreG Registration System.</p>
            <p>Click on the button below to activate your account on SWAreG.  Your badge will already
            be associated with your username.  As you already provided us with your email address at
            the point of sale, all you have to do is setup a password with us.  That's it!</p>
            <p>Although creating an account isn't required, it helps us give you the support you need
            and will allow you to take full advantage of all cons that use our system!  So please register
            today, you have nothing to lose!</p>
